# Fashion AI App - Cursor Rules

## Development Pace
- Never implement more than 2-3 functions or 2-3 classes at a time
- Wait for review and understanding before proceeding
- Keep changes small and incremental

## Architecture
- Backend (`backend/`) handles HTTP, DB, orchestration
- ML (`ml/`) is pure library code - no DB/HTTP dependencies
- ML never imports from backend
- Frontend (`frontend/`) calls backend API

## Code Style
- Python: Type hints, Pydantic schemas, SQLAlchemy models
- Frontend: TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Next.js patterns
- Write tests for new features
